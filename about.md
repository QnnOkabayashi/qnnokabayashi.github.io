I'm a senior at Swarthmore College studying CS and math, and I'm particularly
interested in working with compilers and developer tooling in open source
environments using Rust.

I started developing in Rust in late 2020, and have since worked on a distributed
tracing tool for Google Summer of Code, as well as a Rust FFI tool at Google.
I've also authored some small crates like [`tracing-forest`], [`strck`], and
[`compiled-uuid`].

[`compiled-uuid`]: https://crates.io/crates/compiled-uuid
