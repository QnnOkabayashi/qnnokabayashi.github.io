I'm an incoming software engineer at Google, and have interests in compilers and developer tooling in Rust.
I previously graduated from Swarthmore College with a BA double major in math and computer science.

I started developing in Rust in late 2020, and have since worked on a distributed
tracing tool for Google Summer of Code, as well as a Rust FFI tool at Google.
I've also authored some small crates like [`tracing-forest`], [`strck`], and
[`compiled-uuid`].
