I'm a junior at Swarthmore College double majoring in Computer Science and Statistics. My interests include compilers, concurrency, and numerical computing, and I hope to develop efficient tools and libraries for using in machine learning and other areas of data science. Outside of programming, I love working out, skiing, longboarding, and gaming.
