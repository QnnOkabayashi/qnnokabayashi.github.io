I'm a senior at Swarthmore College studying CS and math interested in working
with compilers and developer tooling in open source environments. In particular,
I started developing in Rust in late 2020 and have since worked on a distributed
tracing tool for Google Summer of Code, as well as a Rust FFI tool at Google.
